## JS Object to JSON file script

**Usage:** Add any data you want to convert to an independent json file as a javascript
object in `data.js` in the `const data` array, and make sure each object has a *string* 
`title` property.

Then, run: 

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

The output data will be in the `json_data` folder, where there will be independent json files for each javascript object element in the array of the `data.js` file.

That's it! Enjoy your json data :)
